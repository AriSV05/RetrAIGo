## RetroAIGo - UNA- 2024

This project is an 8-piece puzzle game. It has 6 initial states, and each one will try to reach the final state: [empty, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]. To achieve this, the Manhattan and Hamming algorithms were used. The webpage was created using Express, written in JavaScript, while the game logic and algorithms were implemented in Prolog.
